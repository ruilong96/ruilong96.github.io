With a strong belief in equal opportunity in education, Riiid launched an AI tutor based on deep-learning algorithms in 2017 that attracted more than one million South Korean students. This year, the company released EdNet, the world’s largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million student interactions.\nThe challenge is to create algorithms for \u0026ldquo;Knowledge Tracing,\u0026rdquo; the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. You will pair your machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data.\nExploratory Data Analysis For this analysis, Kaggle provides us with a massive dataset containing five anonymized files, in which of three contains the details about the students' activities online, the details about the questions, and the details about the lectures. The dataset is a time-series data, and the students' data is recorded chronologically relative to their entry to the system.\nTo understand the dataset better, I conducted an exploratory analysis which yielded the following observation:\n  answer_correctly is not balanced in a way that the answer correctly cases is more than the answer incorrectly cases.\n  From user_id distribution plot, most of the users does not have a lot of activities.\n  We observe that the same long left tail distribution for three categorical variables(user_id, task_id, task_container_id), indicating a lot specific instances or users does not have a lot of occurrences.\n  As we can see that some distribution plot has a long left tail which is an indicator of outliers because it suggests that some specific users may have very different patterns than the rest of the user.\n   timestamp is correlated with task_container_id and prior_question_had_explanation content_id is correlated with content_type_id showing that they are somehow related. prior_question_had_explanation has positive correlation answered_correctly, implying that the explanation may help the pupils learn better. Together with the correlation with timestamp, it may indicate that the longer usage of the platform results in better performance.  More details are presented in this notebook\nData Prepossessing Since the training dataset is massive and the computing resource is limited on the Kaggle platform, we need to cross sampling data without losing generality, and the data preparing and cleaning consisted of the following steps:\n  The given timestamp is the time that has elapsed since the user\u0026rsquo;s first event, not the actual time, so I set a random first access time for each user within a certain interval.\n  Splits the data into training and validation data based on the timestamp. To simulate the learning process, the later part of the data is used for validation data.\n  Isolate the input data and compute the summary transformation (e.g. sum, count) and then Iteratively select the important ones.\n  To mimic the learning process and handling new users, progressively update the user statistics, such as the correct answer rate, number of question answered.\n  For NA values, we filled in the average values accordingly based on our summary transformation before, or filled in False for Boolean values.\n  Lastly, convert all variables into numerical variables for LSBM model.\n  Modeling LSBM The first method used for knowledge tracing model was the LSBM model due to its interpretability and the computational speed. The hyperparameters are tuned within the model, and cross-validated on the prepared validation data to avoid overfitting.\nThe final training\u0026rsquo;s auc is 0.754181, and valid_1\u0026rsquo;s auc is 0.758319.\nTo see more detail, please check out here(html)\nDNN (in progress) Since the dataset is a time-series dataset tracing students' knowledge, the deep neural network with its feed forward feature can better approximate students' performance and make prediction. I am planning to use PyTorch to implement this neural net with convolution and pooling layers.\n","date":1605795589,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605795589,"objectID":"99fefb74fb32cb746b431fc2dba310d1","permalink":"https://ruilong96.github.io/project/riiid-challenge-2020/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T09:19:49-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/riiid-challenge-2020/","section":"project","summary":"Track knowledge states of 1M+ students in the wild - **Use LSBM model and feature engineering and achieve 75.8% accuracy in prediction**","tags":[],"title":"Riiid AIEd Challenge 2020","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ruilong Zhuang"],"categories":[],"content":"Experiment Overview: Free Trial Screener At the time of this experiment, Udacity courses currently have two options on the course overview page: \u0026ldquo;start free trial\u0026rdquo;, and \u0026ldquo;access course materials\u0026rdquo;. If the student clicks \u0026ldquo;start free trial\u0026rdquo;, they will be asked to enter their credit card information, and then they will be enrolled in a free trial for the paid version of the course. After 14 days, they will automatically be charged unless they cancel first. If the student clicks \u0026ldquo;access course materials\u0026rdquo;, they will be able to view the videos and take the quizzes for free, but they will not receive coaching support or a verified certificate, and they will not submit their final project for feedback.\nIn the experiment, Udacity tested a change where if the student clicked \u0026ldquo;start free trial\u0026rdquo;, they were asked how much time they had available to devote to the course. If the student indicated 5 or more hours per week, they would be taken through the checkout process as usual. If they indicated fewer than 5 hours per week, a message would appear indicating that Udacity courses usually require a greater time commitment for successful completion, and suggesting that the student might like to access the course materials for free. At this point, the student would have the option to continue enrolling in the free trial, or access the course materials for free instead. This screenshot shows what the experiment looks like.\nExperiment Setup The hypothesis was that this might set clearer expectations for students upfront, thus reducing the number of frustrated students who left the free trial because they didn\u0026rsquo;t have enough time—without significantly reducing the number of students to continue past the free trial and eventually complete the course. If this hypothesis held true, Udacity could improve the overall student experience and improve coaches' capacity to support students who are likely to complete the course.\nNull Hypothesis: No significant change and ineffective in reducing the early Udacity course cancellation.\nAlternative Hypothesis: This reduces the number of frustrated students who left the free trial.\nThe unit of diversion is a cookie, although if the student enrolls in the free trial, they are tracked by user-id from that point forward. The same user-id cannot enroll in the free trial twice. For users that do not enroll, their user-id is not tracked in the experiment, even if they were signed in when they visited the course overview page.\nExperiment Design Metric Choice First, we need to pick Invariant metrics. Invariant metrics are the ones used for sanity checks and will remain stable throughout the experiment. In our case,\n  Number of cookies: That is, number of unique cookies to view the course overview page.\n  Number of clicks: That is, the number of unique cookies to click the “Start free trial” button (which happens before the free trial screener is a trigger).\n  Click-through-probability: That is, number of unique cookies to click the “Start free trial” button divided by number of unique cookies to view the course overview page.\n  Then, we have to set up Evaluation Metrics. Evaluation metrics are the ones that we care about, the metrics that must be observed for consideration in the decision to launch the experiment. In our experiment, we have\n  Gross conversion: That is, the number of user-ids to complete checkout and enroll in the free trial divided by the number of unique cookies to click the “Start free trial” button. (dmin= 0.01)\n  Retention: That is, the number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by number of user-ids to complete checkout. (dmin=0.01)\n  Net conversion: That is, number of user-ids to remain enrolled past the 14-day boundary (and thus make at least one payment) divided by the number of unique cookies to click the “Start free trial” button. (dmin= 0.0075)\n  Measure Variability Before we dive into experiment design, we need to have a sense about the variability of both of the invariant metrics and evaluation metrics. Udacity provided the baseline values for each metric:\nThe standard deviation is calculated given a sample size of 5000 cookies visiting the course overview page.\nfrom math import sqrt n_pageviews=40000 n_clicks=3200 n_enroll=660 ctp=0.08 n_sample=5000 click_through_probability=0.08 #clicks / pageviews gross_conversion=0.20625 # enroll / click retention=0.53 # payment / enroll net_conversion=0.1093125 # payment / click \u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot;analytical standard deviation estimate\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026quot; # gross_conversion std_gross_conversion=sqrt(gross_conversion*(1-gross_conversion)/(n_clicks/n_pageviews*n_sample)) # retention std_retention=sqrt(retention*(1-retention)/(n_enroll/n_pageviews*n_sample)) # net_conversion std_net_conversion=sqrt(net_conversion*(1-net_conversion)/(n_clicks/n_pageviews*n_sample)) print(\u0026quot;SD of gross conversion(clicks): {:.4} \u0026quot;.format(std_gross_conversion)) print(\u0026quot;SD of Retention(enroll): {:.4} \u0026quot;.format(std_retention)) print(\u0026quot;SD of Net Conversion(clicks): {:.4}\u0026quot;.format(std_net_conversion))  SD of gross conversion(clicks): 0.02023 SD of Retention(enroll): 0.05495 SD of Net Conversion(clicks): 0.0156  Determine the sample size It is very important to figure out the sample size in order to achieve enough statistical significance and power in our analysis based on our assumptions and goals. In our cases, we choose $\\alpha$ = 0.05 and $\\beta$ = 0.2 to calculate the sample size for the selected evaluation metrics. There are two approaches to determine the experiment sample size Learned from here:\nApproach A:\nIf we assume that the standard deviations of the population proportion and the sample proportion are equal and that also the sample sizes of treatment and control group are the same, then the required experiment sample size per group can be determined through (as outlined here):\n$$n=2(z_{1−α/2}+z_{1−β})^2∗ \\frac{σ^2}{d_{min}^2}$$\nwith $σ=SE * \\sqrt{n}$ ,whereby here n is the sample size we used to calculate SE earlier.\nApproach B:\nIf we do not assume common standard deviations then a more precise way to determine the required sample size would be (as outlined here). This is also the approach used by many online sample size calculators such as the one by Evan Miller and we will apply it in the following.\ndef get_sampleSize (alpha, beta, p, dmin): '''Return sample size given alpha, beta, p and dmin''' return (pow((stats.norm.ppf(1-alpha/2)*(2*p*(1-p))**0.5+stats.norm.ppf(1-beta)*(p*(1-p)+(p+dmin)*(1-(p+dmin)))**0.5),2))/(pow(dmin,2))  print(get_sampleSize(0.05, 0.2, gross_conversion, 0.01)) print(get_sampleSize(0.05, 0.2, retention, 0.01)) print(get_sampleSize(0.05, 0.2, net_conversion, 0.0075))  Here are the result:\nClicks for Gross Conversion = 25835\nClicks for Retention = 39115\nClicks for Net Conversion = 27413\nBecause we are having two groups, control and experiment groups in our experiment, therefore the pageview required for each metric are:\nGross Conversion = (28835*2)/0.08 = 645875\nRetention = (39115*2)/(660/40000) = 4741212\nNet Conversion = (27413*2)/0.08 = 685325\nIf we want to test out all of the three metrics, the sample size for the number of pageviews is the maximum 4741212.\nChoosing experiment duration and exposure Some Udacity questions on this part is as follows: What percentage of Udacity’s traffic would you divert to this experiment (assuming there were no other experiments you wanted to run simultaneously)? Is the change risky enough that you wouldn’t want to run on all traffic?\nGiven the percentage you chose, how long would the experiment take to run, using the analytic estimates of variance? If the answer is longer than a few weeks, then this is unreasonably long, and you should reconsider an earlier decision.\nBased on the description of the project, this feature change is not risky in term of the content and the ways for students accessing the content. It simply add one more question before the student accessing the course materials. Therefore, probably we can run on all the traffic if necessary.\nBased on the sample size we need for each metrics, we need 4741212 pageviews in total, and it take around 119 days to run the experiment if we divert all the pageviews given 40000 pageviews a day. Apparently, the experiment takes too long and costly, so we should reconsider the decision about the metric we choose. We can choose the second largest sample size, 685325, to test out Gross Conversion and Net Conversion. In this case, it takes 17 days if we use all of the traffic or it takes 21 days if we use 80% of the traffic.\nExperiment Analysis Sanity Check In our experiment, we need to make sure some invariant metrics stay the same throughout the experiment, and this is one of the ways to make sure our experiment is executed as we designed and expected. We expect that the total number of pageviews in the control group and the experiment group each account for 50% of the total number of pageviews diverted by cookies.\nThe first step of the sanity check for pageviews and clicks is to calculate the probability for the control group and the experiment group.\n# pageviews sum_pv_cont= df['pageviews_control'].sum() sum_pv_exp= df['pageviews_exp'].sum() SD_pageviews= sqrt(0.5*0.5/(sum_pv_cont+sum_pv_exp)) m=1.96*SD_pageviews ci_lower,ci_upper=0.5-m,0.5+m print(\u0026quot;Confidence Interval for pageviews: [{:.4},{:.4}]\u0026quot;.format(ci_lower,ci_upper)) print(\u0026quot;Observed: {:.4}\u0026quot;.format(sum_pv_cont/(sum_pv_exp+sum_pv_cont)))  (check out more code in the following attachment)\n    Pageviews Clicks     Probability = # Control / # Total 0.5006 0.5005   Standard Error = 1.96*SE ($\\alpha$=0.05) 0.0006 0.0041   Lower bound 0.4988 0.4959   Upper bound 0.5012 0.5041   Significance False False    Since the probability for both Pageviews and Click falls within the confidence interval calculated from the binomial distribution, we believe that these two invariant metrics pass the sanity check.\nFrom Click Through probability, we expect that the difference between two groups be zero, so we will use pooled statistics to do the sanity check.\n    Click Through Probability     $\\hat{d}$ 0.00005   SE_Pool_p 0.00066   Lower bound -0.00129   Upper bound 0.00129    Since the observed different $\\hat{d}$ falls in the confidence interval, the Click Through Probability passes the sanity test.\nEffect size tests The focus here is to find out whether our evaluation metrics are statistically and practically significant. It can be achieved by calculating the confidence interval for the difference between the control and experiment groups.\nJust a quick recap: A metric is statistically significant if the confidence interval does not include 0 (that is, you can be confident there was a change), and it is practically significant if the confidence interval does not include the practical thresholds we set at the beginning (that is, you can be confident there is a change that matters to the business.)\nWith the power of the size of the sample we have, we can evaluate the Gross Conversion and Net Conversion for our last piece.\n    Gross Conversion Net Conversion     dmin 0.01 0.0075   Observed Difference -0.0205 -0.0048   CI lower bound -0.0291 -0.0116   CI upper bound -0.012 0.019   Statistically significance True False   Practically significance True False    For Net Conversion, the difference between control and experiment groups is insignificant. The confidence interval include both 0 and negative dmin. For Gross Conversion, the confidence interval does not include 0 or practical significance, therefore it is both statistically and practically significant.\nSign test The sign test is to check whether the signs of the difference of the metrics between the experiment and control groups agree with the confidence interval of the difference. The p-value indicates the likelihood that the result of the signs is happen by chance using binomial distribution.\nAs our code indicates, Gross Conversion has a statistically significant result from the sign test, and Net conversion does not have the same result.\nRecommendation The goal of this experiment is designed to understand whether the screen will filter the students who cannot commit themselves to finish the courses at the end, and thus help to reduce the number of students who left the free trial, while not reducing the number of students who will make the payment after completing their free trial. Our experiment show that Gross Conversion will be reduced significantly, and the Net Conversion rate has no significant change. Therefore, the screener will help to reduce the students who start the free trial, but there is not enough evidence to show that there will be more students who make the payments and continue their courses. Thus, I would not recommend Launching this screener.\nSee implementation(code, html)\n","date":1605743837,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605743837,"objectID":"6c0273b545b426a6cbcc2f183551a835","permalink":"https://ruilong96.github.io/project/a-b-testing-udacity/","publishdate":"2020-11-18T18:57:17-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/a-b-testing-udacity/","section":"project","summary":"Final Project from Udacity A/B testing by Google: This report includes Design, Validation, Analysis \u0026 Recommendation Using Python","tags":[],"title":"A/B Testing Experiment — A Udacity Course Final Project","type":"project"},{"authors":["Ruilong Zhuang"],"categories":[],"content":"About the project The main goal of this project is to detect the infected Malaria cells among the images of the parasitized and uninfected cells.\nMethodology   Data: The dataset is acquired from Kaggle dataset a total of 27,558 cell images with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells, which are segmented cells from the thin blood smear slide images from the Malaria Screener research activity.\n  Metadata: The images are stored in two folders labelled as infected and uninfected.
