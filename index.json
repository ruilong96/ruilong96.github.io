Each of images is in RGB format and has size of 142 × 163 pixels.\n  Since the dataset contains a set of image data and the project is a classification problem, I consider that convolution neural network(CNN) is the most reasonable and appropriate approach for this project. Also, it is because CNNs work well with data that has a spatial relationship.\n  Metrics: Tuned and evaluated models through computing the accuracy, presented by confusion matrix and accuracy score on the test set.\n  Result summary  Baseline model:  94.4% accuracy on the test set Precision = 0.9408122833085686 Recall = 0.9200775006054734     Regularized model:  95.8% accuracy on the test set Precision = 0.9501204819277108 Recall = 0.9661847586375888     Model using Keras:  95.27% accuracy on the test set Precision = 0.925703737886479 Recall = 0.9830923793187945    Further Details For more information, check out:\n Project Report Project Code (html or github)  ","date":1605303320,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605303320,"objectID":"7e89e9633367bf2005b4aec9670fee54","permalink":"https://ruilong96.github.io/project/malaria_cell_image_detection/","publishdate":"2020-11-13T16:35:20-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/malaria_cell_image_detection/","section":"project","summary":"Implement Convolution Neural Network and tune hyperparameter using Grid Search to detect infected cells","tags":[],"title":"Malaria Cell Image Detection","type":"project"}]
